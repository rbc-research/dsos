## Background

Suppose we fit a predictive model on a training set and predict on a test set.
Dataset shift [@quionero2009dataset; @moreno2012unifying; @kelly1999impact],
also known as data or population drift,
occurs when training and test distributions are not alike. This is essentially
a sample mismatch problem. Some regions of the data space are either too
sparse or absent during training and gain importance at test time. We want
methods to alert us to the presence of unexpected inputs in the test set
[@rabanser2019failing]. To do so, a measure of divergence between training
and test set is required. Can we not simply use the many modern off-the-shelf
multivariate tests of equal distributions for this?

One reason for moving beyond tests of equal distributions is that they are
often too strict. They require high fidelity between training and test set
everywhere in the input domain. However, not *all* changes in distribution are
a cause for concern -- some changes are benign. Practitioners distrust these
tests because of false alarms. @polyzotis2019data comment:

> sensitive and also uninformative for the typical scale of data in machine learning

Even when the difference is small or negligible, tests of equal distributions
reject the null hypothesis of no difference. An alarm should only be raised if
a shift warrants intervention. Retraining models when distribution shifts are
benign is both costly and ineffective. Monitoring model performance and data
quality is a critical part of deploying safe and mature models in production
[@paleyes2020challenges; @sculley2014machine; @breck2017ml].
To tackle these challenges, we propose `D-SOS` instead.

In comparing the test set to the training set, `D-SOS` pays more attention to
the regions –- typically, the outlying regions –- where we are most vulnerable.
To confront false alarms, it uses a robust test statistic, namely the
weighted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (WAUC). The
weights in the WAUC [@li2010weighted] discount the safe regions of the
distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the
WAUC is being used as a test statistic in this context. The goal of `D-SOS` is
to detect *non-negligible adverse shifts*. This is reminiscent of noninferiority
tests [@wellek2010testing], widely used in healthcare to determine if a new
treatment is in fact not inferior to an older one. Colloquially, the `D-SOS`
null hypothesis holds that the new sample is not substantively worse than the
old sample, and not that the two are equal.

`D-SOS` moves beyond tests of equal distributions and lets users specify which
notions of outlyingness to probe. The choice of the score function plays a
central role in formalizing what we mean by *worse*. The scores can come from
out-of-distribution detection, two-sample classification, uncertainty
quantification, residual diagnostics, density estimation, dimension reduction,
and more. While some of these scores are underused and underappreciated in
two-sample tests, they can be more informative in some cases. The main takeaway
is that given a method to assign an outlier score to a data point, `D-SOS`
uplifts these scores and turns them into a two-sample test for no adverse
shift.

## Motivational example

For illustration, we apply `D-SOS` to the canonical `iris` dataset
[@anderson1935irises]. The task is to classify the species of Iris flowers
based on $d=4$ covariates (features) and $n=50$ observations for each
species. The first two principal components of `iris` show that these species
cluster together. We show how `D-SOS` helps diagnose false alarms. We highlight
that (1) changes in distribution do not necessarily hurt predictive performance,
and (2) points in the densest regions of the distribution can be the most
difficult -- unsafe -- to predict.

For the subsequent tests, we split `iris` into 2/3 training and 1/3 test set.
Figure \ref{fig:iris-pca} displays these train-test pairs, split according to
two partitioning strategies. These splits correspond to (1) random sampling and
(2) in-distribution (most dense) examples in the test set. The shape and color
of each point map to species and to train-test membership; the size of each
point is proportional to its weight, a measure of its importance, for the
applicable test.


```{r pca-random, echo=FALSE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/combined_pca_vignette.png")
```

We consider four tests of no adverse shift. Each test uses a different score.
For two-sample classification, this score is the probability
of belonging to the test set. For density-based out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection, the score comes from isolation forest -- this
is (roughly) inversely related to the local density. For residual diagnostics,
it is the out-of-sample (out-of-bag) prediction error from random forests.
Finally, for confidence-based OOD detection (prediction uncertainty), it is
the standard error of the mean prediction from random forests.
Only the first notion of outlyingness -- two-sample
classification -- pertains to modern tests of equal distributions; the others
capture other meaningful notions of adverse shifts. For all these scores, higher
is *worse*: higher scores indicate that the observation is diverging from the
desired outcome or that it does not conform to the training set.

How do the splits in Figure 1 fare with respect to
the tests? Let $s$ and $p$ denote $s-$value and $p-$value. The
results are reported on the $s = -\, \log_{2}(p)$ scale because it is intuitive
and lends itself to comparison. An $s-$value of $k$ can be interpreted
as seeing $k$ independent coin flips with the same outcome -- all heads or
all tails -- if the null is that of a *fair* coin [@greenland2019valid]. This
conveys how incompatible the data is with the null. For plotting, we
winsorize (clip) $s-$values to a low and high of 1 and 10 respectively. We
also display a secondary y-axis with the $p-$value as a cognitive bridge.

In Figure 2, the case with (1) random sampling exemplifies
the type of false alarms we want to avoid. Two-sample classification, standing
in for tests of equal distributions, is incompatible with the null of no adverse
shift (a $s-$value of around 8). But this shift does not carry over to the
other tests. Residual diagnostics, density-based and confidence-based OOD
detection are all fairly compatible with the view that the test set is not worse.
Had we been entirely reliant on two-sample classification, we may not have
realized that this shift is essentially benign. Tests of equal distributions
alone give a narrow perspective on dataset shift.

```{r dsos-outlier, echo=FALSE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/combined_dsos_vignette.png")
```

Returning to Figure 2, density-based OOD detection does not
flag the (2) in-distribution test set as expected.
We might be tempted to conclude that the in-distribution observations are
*safe*, and yet, the tests based on residual diagnostics and confidence-based
OOD detection are fairly incompatible with this view. Some of the densest
points are concentrated in a region where the classifier does not discriminate
well: the species 'versicolor' and 'virginica' overlap. That is, the densest
observations are not necessarily safe. Density-based OOD detection glosses over
this: the trouble may well come from inliers that are difficult to predict.
We get a more holistic perspective of dataset shift because of these
complementary notions of outlyingness.

The point of this exercise is twofold. First, we stress the limits of
tests of equal distributions when testing for dataset shift. They are
unable, by definition, to detect whether the shift is benign or not.
Second, we propose a family of tests based on outlier scores, `D-SOS`,
which offers a more holistic view of dataset shift. `D-SOS`
is flexible and can be easily extended to test for other modern notions of
outlyingness such as trust scores [@jiang2018trust]. We hope this
encourages more people to test for *adverse* shifts.
