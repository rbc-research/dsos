\title{dsos: Dataset Shift with Outlier Scores}
\description{
Test for no adverse shift in two-sample comparison when we
    have a training set, the reference distribution, and a test set. The
    approach is flexible and relies on a robust and powerful test
    statistic, the weighted AUC. Technical details are in Kamulete, V. M.
    (2021) <arXiv:1908.04000>. Modern notions of outlyingness such as
    trust scores and prediction uncertainty can be used as the underlying
    scores for example.
