Description: Test for no adverse shift in two-sample comparison when we
    have a training set, the reference distribution, and a test set. The
    approach is flexible (extensible) and relies on a robust and powerful test
    statistic, the weighted AUC. See Kamulete, V. M. (2021) <arXiv:1908.04000>
    for details. Outlier scores such as trust scores and prediction uncertainty
    can be used as the basis for comparison for example.
